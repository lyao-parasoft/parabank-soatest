This error can also occur when a column that is extracted via various Data Bank tools (e.g., XML Data Bank, Browser Data Bank) is renamed or removed.  Please verify whether the column still exists in the data source or the Data Bank tool.  When there are multiple data sources in the test suite, verify the data source specified in the Data Source drop down box in the upper right hand corner of the UI.  If the column has been renamed or removed, please select a new column in the UI.

If the column is extracted via a Data Bank tool, also verify whether the Data Bank tool was executed and whether the Data Bank tool received the input that it expected.
